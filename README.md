# SimulinkLibraryArduino
Hey every one. Im electrical engineering and computer science student at temple. I have volunteered to help my professor to build a library using Matlab &amp; Simulink for the arduino uno. We will teach high school kids in the community about electronics, robatics and computer programing. We are doing this to generate interest computer science and engineering for High School kids. Our goal is to introduce basic concepts and fundementals in a fun and interactive structure. In order to not overwhelm them with programing and circuit designs we are using simulink to make a arduino library of blocks. Once i get the basics down of matlab i will begin making the library. I think its a great idea to expose kids to electronics and computing at the high school level, and show them how cool, fun and intersting it is. If any one can help or shed some idea s it would be awesome. This is also my first time on gethub.
